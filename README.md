**[Devices](./markdown/devices.md)** - markdown page with all devices with image, model id, product number

### What is this repository for?
It was created because Xiaomi has a very confusing lineup with many undocumented differences. 
There is no single source of information about the relationship between **Model ID -> Model / Product Number**. 
I hope this repository will help developers not get confused in this zoo of devices.
